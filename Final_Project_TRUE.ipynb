    "<strong>Introduction:</strong>\n",
    "The objective of this machine learning project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the prices of used cars based on various features and attributes. Our aim is to assist both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions about used car sales by providing reliable price estimations. Users can leverage the model to identify good or bad deals based on the actual and predicted prices of the vehicles. The project will involve data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to achieve the desired outcome.\n",
    "The project seeks to address the following research questions: How accurately can the machine learning model predict the sale price of used cars based on the given features? Which features have the most significant impact on the car's price, according to the model? How does the performance of different machine learning algorithms (e.g. Multiple Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest) compare in predicting used car prices?"

    "<strong>Data Description:</strong>\n",
    "The dataset contains information on used cars in India, including make and model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, number of previous owners, and whether the car is being sold individually or by a dealer. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and comprises 1874 samples of used car listings after missing values have been removed.<br><br>\n",

    "<strong>Machine Learning Techniques:</strong>\n",
    "For this project, we plan to implement the following machine learning techniques: Multiple Linear Regression: This method is suitable for predicting continuous numerical values, making it ideal for estimating used car prices. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN): KNN can help identify similar cars based on feature similarities, which may aid in pricing comparisons. Random Forest: As a powerful ensemble technique, Random Forest can handle complex non-linear relationships between features and car prices effectively. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA can help generate new features from the data that may be able to describe the complex relationships between particular features better than the features alone.\n",
    "To assess the performance of our machine learning models, we will employ the following evaluation metrics for our models: Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual car prices. R-squared: R-squared indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable (car prices) that is predictable by the model."

    "<strong>Project Steps:</strong>\n",
    "The project will follow these steps: Data Collection and Exploration: Gather the used car dataset and perform preliminary data exploration to understand its structure and characteristics. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering. Additionally, apply PCA to extract relevant features. Data Visualization: Visualize the relationships between different features and the target variable to gain insights into the data. Model Selection and Training: Implement the chosen machine learning algorithms and train them on the preprocessed dataset. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using the defined evaluation metrics. Conclusion and Future Work: Summarize the results, draw conclusions, and discuss possible avenues for further improvement. By successfully executing this project, we aim to provide a valuable tool for potential used car buyers and sellers, enhancing transparency and informed decision-making in the used car market."

In addition, we included the drop_first=True tag to drop one of the categorical variables when converting to binary variables. This helps mitigate multi-collinearity when the presence of one variable indicates the lack of presence of another. By dropping one of the variables, we can reduce the effect of the double encoded value (for example a 1 in Make_BMW may always indicate a 0 in Make_Chevrolet, thus the including both in the model may artifically increase the effect of the double encoded value)."
